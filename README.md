# NumPy Analysis Exercises

This project contains analytical exercises implemented in Python using NumPy in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Overview
The notebook includes five main exercises:

1. **Median Algorithm Speed Test**  
   Compare median calculation using pure Python vs. NumPy.

2. **Dispersion Analysis**  
   Generate two groups of data, calculate mean and standard deviation, and visualize with boxplots.

3. **Outlier Detection Comparison**  
   Identify outliers in sales data using IQR and 3-sigma methods, and compare their effect on mean and median.

4. **Correlation Analysis**  
   Calculate the correlation coefficient between work hours and production.

5. **Exam Score Prediction**  
   Generate exam scores based on study hours and calculate descriptive statistics.
